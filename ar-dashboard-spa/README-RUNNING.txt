How to share and run the AR Dashboard (no coding required)

1) Owner does this once
   - Open a terminal in this folder (ar-dashboard-spa)
   - Run: npm install
   - Run: npm run build
   - This creates a "dist" folder with the site files.

2) Share with colleagues
   - Zip the entire ar-dashboard-spa folder (including the "dist" folder)
   - Send the zip to colleagues (or put it on a shared drive)

3) Colleagues run it
   - Unzip the folder anywhere on their computer
   - Double‑click Open-AR-Dashboard.bat
   - Their default browser opens the dashboard (no install needed)

Notes
 - The app runs entirely in the browser; data stays on the machine.
 - If the browser blocks local files, try Chrome/Edge or right‑click Open-AR-Dashboard.bat → Run as administrator.
 - If you see a "Build not found" message, ask the owner to run the build step and re‑share the folder with the "dist" folder included.
