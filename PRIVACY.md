- Client-side processing: The AR Dashboard SPA runs entirely in your browser. When you drop or open a file, parsing and analysis happen locally. The app does not upload your data.
- No analytics: There is no analytics or tracking in the SPA.
- No auth: Firebase/Google Identity sign-in and cloud sync are not used.
- Sharing/Export: If you choose to export results (e.g., to Excel), the file is generated locally and saved by your browser.
- Future changes: Any feature that sends data to a server will be opt-in, clearly labeled, and documented in this file.
